- get latest task definition for the current task and compare it to ours \
	if they're the same skip and use the latest
- use logger

DONE... well almost
- treat exceptions better, see http://botocore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client_upgrades.html#error-handling
except ClientError as e:
    print e / e.response / e.message
- add resource tagging
- move to variable instead of hardcoding the logGroup name
- move VPC and subnets CidrBlock to variables?? needed?
